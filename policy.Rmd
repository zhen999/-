This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
cov<-read.csv('/Users/zhen/desktop/0511.csv')
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
getContent<-function(country){
  filter(cov,grepl(country,COUNTRY))[,2:3]
}
```


```{r}
country3<-c("Japan","India","Indonesia","Russia","Malaysia","Turkeys","Singapore","Mexico","Brazil")
country2<-c("Kingdom","France","German","Span","Italy","America","Sweden","Denmark","Norway","Holland","Canada")
country1<-c("China","Korea")
```

```{r}
policy1<-lapply(1:length(country1),function(x) getContent(country1[x])) %>%
  do.call('rbind',.)
policy2<-lapply(1:length(country2),function(x) getContent(country2[x])) %>%
  do.call('rbind',.)
policy3<-lapply(1:length(country3),function(x) getContent(country3[x])) %>%
  do.call('rbind',.)

policy<-lapply(paste0('policy',1:3), function(x) eval(as.name(x))) %>%
  do.call('rbind',.)
write.csv(policy,'/Users/zhen/desktop/policy.csv')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
